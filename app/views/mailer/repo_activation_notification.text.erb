Hi <%= @username %>,

Hound is now enabled on https://github.com/<%= @repo.full_github_name %>. When it finds Ruby style guide violations, it will comment inline on pull requests.

You can configure which guidelines Hound should consider a violation. Find out more about configuring Hound at https://houndci.com/configure.
